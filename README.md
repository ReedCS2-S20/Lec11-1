# Lecture 11-1: THE C++ STL

This contains the slides PDF and sample code for a lecture
that gives an overview of the C++ Standard Template Library
(the STL), and a quick survey of the `std::vector` container
class template.

The samples folder contains some simple test code that 
demonstrates use of a `vector` and several of its methods.
There are plenty of good/better examples of using `vector`
on-line.

I'm hoping to also add a solution to Project 1 *Stats and Chats*
that instead uses several of the STL containers, including `map`,
also relies on `sort`.
